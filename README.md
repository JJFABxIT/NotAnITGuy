**Welcome to the official repository of NotanITGuy**, your hub for all things related to virtualisation, containerisation, self-hosting, and cybersecurity! Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or a seasoned IT enthusiast, this repository contains resources, configuration files, and detailed guides that complement the videos i will uploading on my YouTube channel.

#### Background

 **I'm Jake, a self taught IT enthusiast!** I have a unique perspective of IT due to my background as a mechanical engineer. Through my 
 Youtube channel, i'm sharing videos and tutorials on a variety of technologies such as networking, containerisation and virtualisation as well
 as general cyber security. With no formal education in IT (i'm currently embarking on my first degree!) i know how scary some of these 
 technologies and terminoligies are, but together we can walk through all the required steps to get you self hosting your own media sever, 
 DNS server as well as a whole suite of docker containers in no time! 
 
 Whether you are just an overly curious individual like myself or an IT professional, join me on my journey into the world of IT
